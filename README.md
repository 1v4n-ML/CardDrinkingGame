# CardDrinkingGame
*This was an attempt to convert a game i used to play with friends with a deck of cards into a digital version.*

## Rules
Each round a player draws a card, each card has a minigame or an action, the card plays out and its the next players turn. There's no winner, play until you survive

### Fully customizeable deck
Edit all the cards or just disable them to adjust the minigames to the public

### 3 sets
You can have up to 3 presets of deck (save system coming soon)
